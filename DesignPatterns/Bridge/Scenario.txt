Our application requires authentication. The business asked us to be able to authenticate third party applications.
We decided that we wanted to authenticate apps differntly then how we authenticate users. However, everything else about
user and app requests we want to funciton the exact same way. In other words we want to be able to change what the class does
without changing the class.

Observe how all 4 parts of the bridge pattern (listed in bridge_pattern_notes 4-1) are implemented in the class folder.
Run the Demonstration.cs test class to see it in action.
