We want to store user records in a local .csv file. We have a handy dandy CsvDataAdapter that knows how to store data in a CSV.
However, it does not implement the interface we would like. The interface we would like to use is ICsvRepository.cs.

Adapter pattern to the rescue! The CsvRepositoryDataAdapter implements the ICsvRepository by adapting the features of the
CsvDataAdapter. We get all of the goodies of CsvDataAdapter AND we get them in the interface we prefer.
