1. Definition
	a. A source of command (or message) and a series of processing objects. Each processing object
		 contains logic that defines the types of commands it can handle--the rest are passed down
		 the chain. It is essentially an object oriented version of if . . . else if ... else if ... else.
2. Form
	a. Sender --sends-command--> Reciever1 --pass-command--> Receiver2 ---> more-recievers
				^												|															|
				|-------------------process & respond									|
				---------------------------------------------------process & respond
	b. Sender is aware of only one receiver
	c. Each receiver is only aware of the next one
	d. Receivers process the command or send it down the chain
	e. The sender does not know who received it
	f. The first receiver to handle the command termincates the chain
	g. The order of the list matters
3. Problems it solves
	a. Decouples Sending of command from processing
	b. Keeps the process open for extending but closed for editing
	c. Allows you to determine "chain" of processing at run time.
